Not every journey goes to plan. This one taught me something I could not have learned from a study guide.

## The Goal: Three Okta Certifications in Three Months

Earlier this year I enrolled in the **Okta "What's Next" certification promo** — a programme that offered a structured pathway to earn three Okta certifications within a set timeframe. My plan was straightforward: complete all three back to back and significantly strengthen my IAM credentials going into my next role.

The three certifications on the roadmap were:

1. **Okta Certified Practitioner** — foundational concepts
2. **Okta Certified Administrator** — hands-on platform administration
3. **Okta Certified Consultant** — advanced implementation and design

## The Study Approach

I went into this with a proper plan. My core resources were:

- **Okta's official documentation and learning portal** — always the primary source for anything Okta-specific
- **[Okta Certified Professional path on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/okta-certified-professional)** by Tim Warner — an excellent structured course that broke down concepts clearly and gave real context to the platform
- **Premier practice exams** for all three certifications — I used these to simulate the exam environment and identify gaps before sitting the real thing
- **My own personal IAM lab environment** — perhaps the most valuable resource. I set up my own Okta environment where I continuously built new IAM scenarios, tested configurations, and deliberately troubleshot things when they broke. There is no substitute for getting your hands dirty.

## Two Passes — and Real Confidence Built

I passed both the **Okta Certified Practitioner** and the **Okta Certified Administrator** exams.

The combination of reading the official docs, working through Tim Warner's course, and actually configuring things in my own lab gave me solid confidence on both. The Administrator exam in particular felt very achievable because I had been actively troubleshooting real scenarios in my own environment — not just reading about them.

## The Consultant Exam — Failed Twice

I failed the **Okta Certified Consultant** exam. Twice.

I want to be honest about this because I think it is worth documenting, and because I suspect others attempting this path may hit the same wall.

The Consultant exam is a different beast entirely. Where the Practitioner and Administrator exams reward solid understanding of *how* Okta works, the Consultant exam tests your ability to *advise on*, *design*, and *implement* Okta solutions across complex real-world environments. It expects you to think like someone who has sat across from customers, understood their business requirements, navigated technical constraints, and made considered architectural decisions.

That is a level of depth that study materials alone cannot fully replicate.

## What It Taught Me

Failing this exam — especially the second time — gave me a very clear signal:

> **The gap is not in my study materials. The gap is in my real-world experience with Okta.**

The Consultant certification is designed for people who work with Okta professionally — implementing it for organisations, troubleshooting it in production, and advising customers on identity architecture. Without that lived experience, the exam surfaces knowledge gaps that no amount of practice tests can fully close.

This is not a failure of preparation. It is a fair reflection of where I am in my career at this point — and that clarity is actually useful.

## What Comes Next

I have not abandoned this certification. I have just recognised that the right path to passing it runs through real-world IAM experience, not another study session.

My focus now is on securing my next IAM role — ideally one that involves hands-on Okta implementation or administration in a professional environment. Once I have that experience behind me, I am confident the Consultant exam will become far more approachable. The knowledge foundation is already there. What I need now is the context that only real work provides.

When I do pass the Consultant exam — and I will — it will mean something more than a badge. It will represent the full journey: the lab hours, the two failed attempts, the career move, and the eventual mastery that comes from actually doing the work.

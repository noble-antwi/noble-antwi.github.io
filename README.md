# 👋 Hey, I’m Noble  Antwi  
### Cloud Engineer | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m a **Cloud Security professional-in-training** with 4+ years of experience in IT infrastructure — currently pursuing a Master’s in *Applied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics* at **Illinois Institute of Technology**.

My journey is grounded in designing and defending resilient systems:  
- 🛠️ Architecting secure AWS environments  
- 🔍 Capturing & analyzing traffic with Wireshark  
- 🔐 Exploring Zero Trust & Threat Detection frameworks  
- 📚 Documenting every step to help others grow too

This site is where I share my projects, personal notes, and practical insights as I evolve into a **Cloud Security Engineer**. Whether it’s open-source contributions, research writeups, or experiments in logging and monitoring — it’s all part of my mission to blend security, scalability, and simplicity.
